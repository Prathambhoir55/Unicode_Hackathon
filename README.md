# BEST DEAL
---
## Overview
Most of the time is spent finding the best prices from suppliers. To make it easier for a
company to send their requirements and get the prices from multiple vendors a portal was
needed to be created. **BestDeal** offers this specific functionality by acting as a _bridge_ between the client and the vendor. It accepts _Requests for Quotations (RFQs)_ from the client according to his requirements and sends them to the relevant vendors who might be interested in providing a quote. The client can make an informed decision by comparing the various quotes. Thus, the client can procure the required items at the **cheapest rate** and in the **least time**!

## Features
Here is the complete set of features implemented on the portal:

- ### Login and Signup 
    The clients and vendors can separately register on the portal. Token authorization has been implemented on the backend along with email verification via SMTP during Signup.
 
- ### Requirement Docs (RFQs)
    The client is able to create as many requirement docs as desired. Each requirement doc is a collection of many items that the client wants to procure. The client can set a deadline, before which vendors can send their quotes.
